🦕 Just completed a small data challenge on Dinosaur Data Analysis! 🦖
🔍 In this challenge, I had the opportunity to explore a fascinating dataset containing information about various dinosaurs, including their names, heights, ages, and more. I tackled questions ranging from data cleaning to correlation analysis and discovered some intriguing insights along the way.
📊 I started by handling missing values using different imputation techniques such as mean, mode, and median. This ensured that the dataset was ready for analysis without compromising the integrity of the data.
📈 With the data cleaned, I delved into exploring correlations between different attributes. I uncovered interesting relationships, including the correlation between dinosaur height and age. It was fascinating to see how dinosaur sizes varied over time!
🏔️ One of the standout findings was identifying the tallest and shortest dinosaurs in the dataset. It's incredible to imagine these colossal creatures roaming the Earth millions of years ago!
🦖 Overall, it was a fun and educational challenge, and I'm excited to continue exploring more datasets and uncovering hidden insights. Stay tuned for more data adventures! 💼
